I am currently a User Experience design intern with Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Technology, and design desktop, tablet, and mobile applications for the Cast Members of the Disney Parks. Using simulation software, I produce clickable, interactive simulations of applications coupled with detailed design documentation for our development teams. I also conduct user interviews, attend job shadows and perform user testing of my designed applications.

Because my UX work contains sensitive internal company information and workflows copyrighted to Disney, I am not able to present online for you to view. However, please send me an email or get in contact with me and I am able to show you my work via screen share.
