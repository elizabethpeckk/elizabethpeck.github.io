### Personal Project: Posters
My love of design and my love of illustration go hand in hand. These are a few of the posters I've created just for fun. The first of which is from the Disney movie Pocahontas, and the second from the Disney game Kingdom Hearts.

### Personal Project: Animation
These are two projects that I made in Illustrator and animated in After Effects. Even in my free time, I'm always working to refine my skills as a designer and try new forms of visual communication that I don't get to work with while I'm on the clock. I made these animations to be easily shared on social media.
