Dirty White Couch is a recording studio located in South Bend, Indiana. Having no online presence whatsoever, I was tasked with creating both a website and overall brand identity for the studio. Their name is derived from their beginning days of only having a garage to record and an old white couch to sit on. The overall look and feel of the website was inspired by the vibe of vintage Rock nâ€™ Roll with a modern touch.
